A Monster Maker Name Generator

A javascript driven app that takes in a name (alpha characters only, alerts user if restricted characters are used) and delivers a new name based on individual letters giving a 'monster' sounding name.

Feel free to enhance it as you wish if you have any ideas of a better way of writing the code.
